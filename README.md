# Deep-Learning-Projects
Deep Learning and AI project by using Python Keras and Tensorflow


## What is this repository about?

When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other
and help each other to improve the coding skills.There are 2 projects that I have used Machine learning algorithms by applying Python.
I love to share my knowledge with people and also see how people put their opinion on it.

## What projects are in this repository?

- Deep Learning 

**Flower Image Classifier**

>As the name of this project, I am using the deep learning knowledge to create a APP to be able to classify the different image. 
The dataset I used is the famous `iris`flowers dataset which contains 102 flower categories. I needed to train the data, create a model 
to be able to predict what flower is it when the a random flower image shows up.

## What you can do with my projects?

You can feel free to comment on my projects, find the bugs or tell me what your thoughts about my coding, analysis and insight. You can contact with me through my email: saizhang123@gmail.com. I will love to hear your ideas.
You can also take some codes away if you think some of them can be useful for your projects.
